		Around the time of Incantations, Oldfield underwent a controversial self-assertiveness therapy course known as Exegesis, which had a significant effect on his personality for some years, he has described, making him more confident and out-going. Possibly as a result, the formerly reclusive musician staged a major Tour of Europe to promote the album, chronicled in his live album Exposed, much of which was recorded at the National Exhibition Centre near Birmingham. In 1979, he recorded a version of the signature tune of the British children's television programme Blue Peter, which was used by the show for 10 years. In 1981, Oldfield was asked to compose a piece for the Royal Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer, titled "Royal Wedding Anthem".

		<p class="text">In 2015, Red Bull tapped Show Group for the second year in a row to provide creative support for RBMA Bass Camp MTL 2015, hosted in Montreal. Red Bull Music Academy (RBMA) is a world-travelling workshop and festival, a platform for those who make a difference in today’s musical landscape.Three days and three nights of lectures, studio sessions and live performances, all over the city.</p>

		<p class="text--small">Invited participants get the chance to meet legendary artists, producers and industry revolutionaries from across music history via lectures and in-studio collaboration. The RBMA Bass Camp is a local spin-off of this international workshop series: a three-day mini-Academy featuring all elements of RBMA – twenty selected musicians from all over the country come together for lectures, studio sessions, live performances, and real-life bonding over mutual inspiration.</p>

		<p class="text--small">Red Bull sought a brand message that catered largely to the 20 emerging artists participating in the Bass Camp program, but also to extend it to Montrealers for the nightly events. The brand that Show Group established took cues from the city itself — in particular the iconic Farine Five Roses sign in the old port, and the seedier aspects of an old Montreal represented in neon.</p>
		<p class="text--small">Elements of the scope of the project were similar, but the brand established for the creative needed to be updated and particular attention would need to be given to drawing higher attendance at the nightly events. Given the talent this year — Kevin Saunderson, DJ Quik, BadBadNotGood — we targeted the strong college community in Montreal and created out of home, printed media, social media, and on-site collateral with them in mind.</p>
